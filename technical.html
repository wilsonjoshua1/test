                <h2>Youtube to Spotify</h2>
                <h3>I created this program to convert a youtube playlist into a Spotify playlist. 
                    I did this because when I was younger I did not own a spotify account and I created personal playlist for myself. As I got older I started to use spotify more and I did not want to recreate these playlist again on Spotify. Especially since these playlists are a couple of hours long. I created a python script that will use the Spotify API and Youtube API to convert a Youtube Playlist to a Spotify one. </h3>
                    <h3>Here is a screenshot of the script I created to accomplish this. </h3>

                <h3>I enjoy taking pictures as a hobby and at some point I was considering starting to take photos for money. I saw people were either making Instagram pages for their pictures, but I wanted to test myself and create my own website. This website elegantly presents my work to the viewers and has a way for them to contact me personally if they would like a shoot. This also gives them some insight into who I am and what is my goal within every photoshoot that I have.
